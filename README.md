## Conclusion

#### Driving Factors

1. Interest Rate
2. Debt to Income
3. Revolving Credit Utilization
4. Tenure of loan
5. Amount Funded to customer

#### Business Suggesstions

1. Reduce loans given to lower grade consumers
2. Reduce Loan amount approved to lower grade consumers, best to keep it under $15000.
3. Small Businesses and Debt Consolidation has the highest interest rates and they are the highest charged off ones as well. Reduce number of loans approved for Debt Consolidation and more loans can be given under house purpose as it seems to have high interest rates and pay off rates
4. Push for longer tenure and reduce installment value as tenure seems to not affect if the loan is charged off, but higher the installment value greater is the chance of the loan being charged off.
5. Lower the ceiling of loans provided to customers who have greater than 10 years experience. They may not be able to pay in case they face any issues in their company etc.
